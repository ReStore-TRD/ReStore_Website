                <p>An update on how ReStore will be operating given the COVID-19 situation: 
                    ReStore will continue to accept donations during the spring season, but 
                    will not have any hours where we are open to the public. So for students 
                    this means you can give things to ReStore, but not take. All donations will 
                    continue to be no-contact. Household goods can still be dropped off under 
                    the overhang on the south side of the kindergarten (Prestekrageveien 14). 
                    When you drop things off, please send us a picture along with the time/date 
                    of drop-off and we will move it inside after 72 hours. Our operations may 
                    change as regulations and guidelines get updated, so please keep an eye 
                    on our Facebook page for the most current information. Stay safe out 
                    there- we’re all in this together.</p>

                    <h3>New life for used goods</h3>
                    <p>ReStore makes it easier for students to give and get reused goods, keeping 
                        useful stuff out of the bin.   10.000 students from all over Norway and abroad 
                        move to Trondheim every year. To get set up in their new home, every student 
                        needs a few things like a desk lamp, bin, hangers, etc. These items are reusable 
                        and could pass on from one student generation to another. Unfortunately, 
                        containers full of household items in excellent condition are being thrown away 
                        each term. Most students, due to the seasonal gap between supply and demand, 
                        do not have a choice but to let their things go to waste.   ReStore is a student 
                        organization founded to solve this problem. We work together with Sit to reduce 
                        waste by making reuse easier for students. ReStore has set up a space in Moholt 
                        where outgoing students can donate useful items they no longer need. We store 
                        these items over the summer and offer them free of charge to all students at the 
                        beginning of the new semester.   Click on the Facebook link at the bottom of 
                        this page to check out what ReStore is up to now!</p>
