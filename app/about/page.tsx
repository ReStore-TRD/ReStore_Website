        <h2>Our story</h2>
        <p>
          ReStore is a student organization with roots in Trondheim. At ReStore,
          we work towards upcycling goods, with the goal of creating a greener
          and more inclusive society. In May 2019, in a collaboration with SiT
          Bolig, ReStore was set up in an old kindergarten in Moholt student
          village and accepted its first donations from outgoing students. At
          the end of each semester, outgoing students discard tonnes of usable
          goods when they return home from exchange. Every January and August,
          new students arrive and need to buy new housewares- the same types
          that were thrown away only months before. This mismatch in timing
          between supply and demand perpetuates a cycle of waste. ReStore
          bridges this gap and facilitates the reuse of goods by storing donated
          goods for incoming students.
